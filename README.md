# Personal Future Space Project

## Overview
For this project, each participant created a personal future space – a place that reflects where we see ourselves in the future, whether that’s five years from now, after graduation, or once we’ve found our dream lifestyle or career. The spaces are all unique and personal – some are symbolic, some are realistic – but they’re all built around one theme: our future selves.

## My Individual Future Space

For my individual project, I created a studio that symbolizes my past, present, and future. Music has always been a big part of my life, which is why I included a DJ turntable in the space. When moving to that part, you can hear music I’ve played during my DJ sets.

On the other side, there is a computer representing where I am now—just starting out as a frontend developer. On the other side, there is a sewing machine because I’ve always wanted to learn how to make clothes. I recently received a sewing machine as a gift and plan to start my journey with it soon.

Even with all these elements, there’s a cozy corner with a sofa where I can relax and watch TV when I need a break. 

In summary, my future studio is a creative space where I can express all parts of myself.
